			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Bob Belcher and his wife Linda own and operate Bob's Burgers. Bob is a third generation restauranteur, his father Big Bob 
			owned Big Bob's Diner and Bob learned the restaurant business from him, but as a young man he decided to strike out on his own and Bob's Burgers was founded. Bob has a passion for good, homestyle cooking and his skill with food has seen the restaurant through thick and thin.</p> 
			<p>Linda joined Bob in the business after their marriage and her joyful personality makes her the heart of the business. Bob and Linda are devoted parents. His three children, Gene, Louise and Tina attend Waggstaff School and can often be seen helping out their parents at the restaurant.</p>
